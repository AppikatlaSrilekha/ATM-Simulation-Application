ATM Simulation Application

This Java-based ATM simulation provides users with a graphical interface to manage their banking transactions. The application features:

Withdrawal and Deposit Functions:

Users can withdraw or deposit money into their checking account by entering the desired amount and their PIN.
The balance is updated in real-time and displayed on the screen.
PIN Change:

Users can securely change their ATM PIN.
The application verifies the current PIN before allowing the user to set a new one.
Savings Account Access:

Users can view their savings account balance by entering their PIN.
This feature is separate from the checking account operations, providing a simple but effective way to manage different accounts.
User Interface:

The application uses a clean and simple grid layout with text fields, password fields, and buttons to interact with the system.
Balance information for both checking and savings accounts is clearly displayed to the user.
How it Works:

The user interacts with the GUI to perform actions like withdrawing cash or depositing money.
A correct PIN is required for most operations, ensuring security.
The application is designed to handle basic banking needs and simulate a real ATM experience in a controlled environment.
This application is ideal for understanding the basics of event handling in Java GUI development, particularly how to use Swing components to create interactive applications.
