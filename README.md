**ATM Simulation Application**
This Java-based ATM simulation provides users with a graphical interface to manage their banking transactions. The application features:

_Withdrawal and Deposit Functions:_
Users can withdraw or deposit money into their checking account by entering the desired amount and their PIN.
The balance is updated in real-time and displayed on the screen.

_PIN Change:_
Users can securely change their ATM PIN.
The application verifies the current PIN before allowing the user to set a new one.

_Savings Account Access:_
Users can view their savings account balance by entering their PIN.
This feature is separate from the checking account operations, providing a simple but effective way to manage different accounts.

_User Interface:_
The application uses a clean and simple grid layout with text fields, password fields, and buttons to interact with the system.
Balance information for both checking and savings accounts is clearly displayed to the user.
